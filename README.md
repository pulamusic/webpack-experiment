# Experimenting with Webpack setup

This is an experiment to see how Webpack can more efficiently process a project that uses multiple NPM packages. So far, I have added:

* [Webpack & Webpack-cli](https://webpack.js.org/): Webpack does more than a few things. With regard to this project, I should try to setup as much of its capabilities as possible.
  - Dev server
  - Watching & processing Sass, Handlebars, etc.
  - Processing images & audio
  - Tree-shaking and minifying code
* [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/): Google's answer to Bootstrap, I guess.
  - [Material Theme Builder](https://m3.material.io/theme-builder): Material's tool for creating color schemes.
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/): dynamic page elements
* [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/): assertion testing
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/): a very useful CSS preprocessor
* [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/): a templating language
* [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/): used for creating link previews
